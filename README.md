# poetry

*In the future:*
## Store my poems here along with their change history.
__Thus allowing suggestions from others.__

*Inspired by Ginsberg's Howl being passed around his friends and one of them suggesting the first line word "mystical" be replaced with "hysterical", a great change. 

*Also inspired by poems being high-energy outbursts and the difficulty of editing later when the energy is no longer inside the poet.*
